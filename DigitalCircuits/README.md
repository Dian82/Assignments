## Digital Circuits and Logic Design (Laboratory)

This is the repository of chhzh123's assignments of *Digital Circuits and Logic Design (Laboratory)* - Spring 2018 @ SYSU.

* The detailed requirements of the assignments can be found in ''report.pdf'' in each folder.

* The instruments used in the experiments are mostly provided by the school's laboratory, including the oscilloscope, the circuit board, and the *Xilinx Basys 3* FPGA study board.

* All the circuit designs are first simulated in *Proteus 7*, then programmed in *Verilog* and synthesized by *Vivado 2018*.

* The photos in the reports are taken by my phone or directly screenshotted. Specifically, the transition graphs and the Karnaugh graphs are drawn using [draw.io](https://draw.io/) and stored in \*.xml files.
