## Decision Tree (ID3)

My handwritten ID3 algorithm targets solving the UCI problem. Discrete and continuous attributes are supported, and pre-pruning technique is leveraged to avoid overfitting.

The python package dependency is listed in `requirements.txt`, you can simply install them by

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the code, type
```bash
python dt.py
```

But remember to modify the logger title / name first.
