# Convex Optimization

This is the final project of *Convex Optimization* - Spring 2019 @ SYSU lectured by [*Qing Ling*](http://sdcs.sysu.edu.cn/content/3112).

Detailed problems can be found in `Optimization-2019.pdf`.

Three algorithms need to be analyzed and implemented for the LASSO regression problem, including
* Proximal gradient descent
* Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)
* Subgradient method

Two algorithms need to be analyzed and implemented for the logistic/softmax regress problem for the MNIST benchmarks, including
* Gradient Descent
* Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

All the experiments are implemented in Python with pure `numpy` package, and no other deep learning frameworks are used.
