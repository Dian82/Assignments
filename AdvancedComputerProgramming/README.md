# Advanced Computer Programming (Python)

This is the repository of chhzh123's projects of *Advanced Computer Programming (Python)* - Spring 2019 @ SYSU lectured by *Han Lin*.

This course is based on *[MIT 6.0001](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/): Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python* and *[MIT 6.0002](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0002-introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-science-fall-2016/): Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science*.

The [Assignments](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/assignments/) are also the same.

The final project is to finish a data science competition. We select the contest of [predicting happiness](https://tianchi.aliyun.com/competition/entrance/231702/information) in [Tianchi](https://tianchi.aliyun.com/home/). Codes and reports can be found in the `Final` folder.
