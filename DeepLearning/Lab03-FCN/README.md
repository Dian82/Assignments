# TinyTorch

A simple deep learning framework with support of
* Activation functions: ReLU, sigmoid, Tanh
* Loss functions: CrossEntropy
* NN infrastructure: Linear
* Optimizer: SGD with momentum

The core implementation is in `tinytorch` folder. You can directly call it by `import tinytorch`.

`fcn.py` implements the three-layer FCN in TinyTorch, and `fcn_pytorch` gives the PyTorch implementation.
