\begin{answer}\mbox{}\par
\begin{lstlisting}
select sum(credits)
from takes natural join course
where ID = 12345;
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Intermediate SQL}
Using the university schema that you have write the following queries. In some cases you need to insert extra data to show the effect of a particular feature -- this is indicated with the question. You should then show not only the query, but also the insert statements to add the required extra data.

\begin{question}
\normalfont 
Find the maximum and minimum enrollment across all sections, considering only sections that had some enrollment, don't worry about those that had no students taking that section
\end{question}
\begin{answer}\mbox{}\par
\begin{lstlisting}
select max(enrollment), min(enrollment)
from (select sec_id, semester, year, count(distinct id) as enrollment
  from takes
  group by sec_id, semester, year) as T;
\end{lstlisting}
\end{answer}

\begin{question}
\normalfont 
Find all sections that had the maximum enrollment (along with the enrollment), using a subquery.
\end{question}
\begin{answer}\mbox{}\par
\begin{lstlisting}
with T(sec_id, semester, year, enrollment) as
  (select sec_id, semester, year, count(distinct id)
    from takes
    group by sec_id, semester, year)
select T.sec_id, T.semester, T.year, T.enrollment
from T, (select max(enrollment) as maxE, min(enrollment)
  from T) as res
where T.enrollment = res.maxE;
\end{lstlisting}
\end{answer}

\begin{question}
\normalfont 
As in in Q1, but now also include sections with no students taking them; the enrollment for such sections should be treated as 0. Do this in two different ways (and create require data for testing)
\begin{itemize}
\item [(a)] Using a scalar subquery
\item [(b)] Using aggregation on a left outer join (use the SQL natural left outer join syntax)
\end{itemize}
\end{question}
\begin{answer}\mbox{}\par
\begin{lstlisting}
-- Test data (need to preserve the constraints)
delete from course
  where course_id = 'CS-001';
delete from section
  where sec_id = '1' and semester = 'Fall' and year = '2010';
insert into course(course_id)
  values ('CS-001');
insert into section(course_id, sec_id, semester, year)
  values ('CS-001','1','Fall','2010');
-- Q3.1
select distinct sec_id, semester, year,
  (select count(distinct id)
    from takes
    where (takes.sec_id, takes.semester, takes.year) = (section.sec_id, section.semester, section.year)) as cnt
from section;
-- Q3.2
select distinct sec_id, semester, year, ifnull(cnt,0)
from section left outer join
  (select sec_id, semester, year, count(distinct id) as cnt
  from takes
  group by sec_id, semester, year) as T
using (sec_id, semester, year);
\end{lstlisting}
\end{answer}

\begin{question}
\normalfont 
Find all courses whose identifier starts with the string "CS-1"
\end{question}
\begin{answer}\mbox{}\par
\begin{lstlisting}
select course_id, title
from section natural join course
where course_id like 'CS-1%';
\end{lstlisting}
\end{answer}

\begin{question}
\normalfont 
Find instructors who have taught all the above courses
\begin{itemize}
\item [(a)] Using the "not exists ... except ..." structure
\item [(b)] Using matching of counts which we covered in class (don't forget the distinct clause!).
\end{itemize}
\end{question}
\begin{answer}\mbox{}\par
\begin{lstlisting}
-- Q5.1
select distinct ID, name
from (select * from teaches natural join instructor) as T
where not exists (select cs_course.course_id
        from (select course_id
            from course
            where course_id like 'CS-1%') as cs_course
        where cs_course.course_id not in
          (select course_id
            from (select * from teaches natural join instructor) as U
            where U.name = T.name));

-- Q5.2
with U(course_id) as -- all course_id like 'CS-1%'
  (select distinct course_id
    from teaches natural join instructor
    where course_id like 'CS-1%')
select distinct ID, name
from (select * from teaches natural join instructor) as T
where ((select count(distinct course_id)
    from teaches natural join instructor
    where name = T.name and course_id like 'CS-1%')
  = (select count(course_id) from U));
\end{lstlisting}
\end{answer}

\begin{question}
\normalfont 
Insert each instructor as a student, with tot\_creds = 0, in the same department
\end{question}
\begin{answer}\mbox{}\par
\begin{lstlisting}
insert into student
  select ID, name, dept_name, '0'
  from instructor;
\end{lstlisting}
\end{answer}

\begin{question}
\normalfont 
Now delete all the newly added "students" above (note: already existing students who happened to have tot\_creds = 0 should not get deleted)
\end{question}
\begin{answer}\mbox{}\par
\begin{lstlisting}
delete from student
  where (ID, name, dept_name) in
    (select (ID, name, dept_name)
      from instructor);
\end{lstlisting}
\end{answer}

\begin{question}
\normalfont 
Some of you may have noticed that the tot\_creds value for students did not match the credits from courses they have taken. Write and execute query to update tot\_creds based on the credits passed, to bring the database back to consistency. (This query is provided in the book/slides.)
\end{question}
\begin{answer}\mbox{}\par
\begin{lstlisting}
update student as S
set tot_cred = (
  select sum(credits)
  from takes natural join course
  where S.ID = takes.ID and takes.grade is not null);
\end{lstlisting}
\end{answer}

\begin{question}
\normalfont 
Update the salary of each instructor to 10000 times the number of course sections they have taught.
\end{question}
\begin{answer}\mbox{}\par
\begin{lstlisting}
update instructor as I
set salary = 10000 * (
  select count(distinct sec_id, semester, year)
  from teaches as T
  where I.ID = T.ID);
\end{lstlisting}
\end{answer}

\begin{question}
\normalfont 
Create your own query: define what you want to do in English, then write the query in SQL. Make it as difficult as you wish, the harder the better.
\end{question}
\begin{answer}\mbox{}\par
\begin{lstlisting}
-- Number of courses taught by instuctors of CS department registered by the students
select count(cs_course.course_id)
from ((select distinct course_id
    from instructor natural join teaches
    where dept_name = 'Comp. Sci.') as cs_course
  inner join
  (select distinct course_id from takes) as all_course
  on cs_course.course_id = all_course.course_id);
\end{lstlisting}
\end{answer}
